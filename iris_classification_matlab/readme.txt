The scripts irisdata_manipulation and irisdata_manipulation2/3 perform population encoding on the iris data and stores the
results in .mat files with names including iris_data...

the function LIF implements the LIF neuron

trainScript1/2/3 are scripts for training one instance - i.e. for one set of parameters only (use only trainScript3)

test_iris and test_iris2/3 tests a given set of weights and returns number of successful recognitions (again, only use test_iris3)
